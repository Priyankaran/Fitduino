Fitduino
========

Intended to be a project using the Arduino platform to provide a physical representation of your Fitbit statistics.

## Requirements
FitBit.py project - https://github.com/jflasher/FitBit.py
python-oauth2 project - https://github.com/dgouldin/python-oauth2

## Usage
Directions are inline in fitduino.py. It's a couple of copy/paste steps to work through the oauth process. Honestly, it's a bit confusing but a one time thing to set up for something hacky. Obviously, if this is intended for wider distribution, something else needs to be done.
